# Go
Go was created by engineers at Google, among them the C and Unix legends and co-creators of UTF-8, Rob Pike and Ken Thompson. The reason was that they really disliked C++ and wanted to create a simple and safe language for the typical Google workloads, featuring garbage collection and making it very easy to spawn parallel processes that communicate via channels according to the CSP model.

Interestingly it was mostly the Python programmers who converted to Go, as well as Java programmers that felt they were complicating things too much in Java, but Go has become a beloved workhorse in the cloud and for DevOps.

Fun fact: there was (still is) a pre-existing language called Go!, with exclamation mark, in the Prolog family, but almost nobody has been confused by this.

If you want to run your code locally, you need to install go from the [official source](https://golang.org/), or a package manager of your choice.
