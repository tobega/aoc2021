# Ballerina
Ballerina is developed by an Enterprise integration consultancy in southern Asia, because it is unsatisfactory to have a complicated configuration language in an Enterprise Service Bus for 80% use cases and another language for the rest. Then when it was time to release 1.0 in 2018, James Clark (of XML and XSLT fame) was asked to just quickly look it over and he has been improving it ever since. In AoC you won't be needing the miraculously simple REST server or client setup, but it doesn't hurt to get a feel for this language that might become the next big thing in our line of work.

If you want to run Ballerina locally, you need to get it from the [Ballerina language site](https://ballerina.io/)

VSCode and Intellij both have good ballerina plugins.
